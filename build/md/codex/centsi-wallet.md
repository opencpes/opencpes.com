We designed the OpenCPEs centsayWallet from the ground up to be secure and private. The OpenCPEs centsayWallet does not make direct use of your camera, microphone, location or any other data on your phone. For each transaction with the OpenCPEs OCL blockchain, a new transaction key is created. We give the client control of all data sent to and from the OpenCPEs centsayWallet.

You can manually enter self-claims into the OpenCPEs centsayWallet. You can also accept self-claims and third-party claims by passing data to the application using a custom URL scheme. An easy way to do this is via QR codes. We allow clients to choose how and when they enter data, giving you complete control.
