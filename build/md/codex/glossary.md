# Glossary:

**centsi** – centsi (also displayed as “¢entsi”) is a pseudo crypto-currency that can be used to measure the value of any registered claim, including continuing professional education (CPE) claims, it generally maps at 1 centsi per hour of CPE. centsi can also be used to measure the relative value of certifications and other professional achievements.

**Certification** - A certification can be attached to a person and is provided by a third party. Although OpenCPEs supports self-certification claims (e.g. “I claim I can do X”), it is generally accepted that certifications are defined by third parties (e.g. a certification body).

**Certification Claim** - A certification claim is any certification that a person claims to have, but the certification is not yet registered in the OpenCPEs system. The next step would be to use the OpenCPE Wallet to register it, resulting in a “Registered Claim”.

**Confirmed Certification Claim or CPE Claim** – A claim can be combined with a piece of digital evidence (such as an image or a PDF) which is confirmed with a trusted third party. If confirmed, it is then processed and an OpenCPE record is created and written to the OCL blockchain. Please note that this feature is not yet available.

**Continuing Professional Education (CPE)** – Continuing professional education (CPE) is defined as ANY activity related to common information security practitioner activities such as attending or giving conference talks, creating or consuming new information security content (such as blog postings, podcasts, videos, etc.), finding, fixing, and helping deal with security vulnerabilities and incidents, to name a few activities.

**Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Claim** – A CPE claim is any CPE activity that someone claims to have done, but the activity not yet registered in the OpenCPEs system. The next step would be to use the OpenCPE Wallet to register it, resulting in a “Registered Claim”.

**Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Provider** – A CPE provider can be a traditional CPE provider, such as an online training designed to provide CPEs for the information security industry, or a less traditional CPE provider, such as an information security-related podcast. Please note that a third-party CPE provider is not even required for a CPE claim, as self claims can be made (e.g. “I wrote this blog posting about information security topic X”).

**Open Cybersecurity Ledger (OCL)** – The Open Cybersecurity Ledger (OCL) is a customized blockchain technology developed by Cloud Security Alliance Labs that ensures the privacy of client data and the security of data entered into the OCL blockchain. Currently it is a permissioned, public blockchain (the data is available publicly in real time).

**OpenCPEs OCL blockchain** - The OpenCPEs OCL blockchain is the actual data structure holding the registered claims. It is currently viewable at [https://blockchain-data.opencpes.com/](https://blockchain-data.opencpes.com/)

**OpenCPEs centsiWallet** - The OpenCPEs centsiWallet is the mobile client (currently available in technical beta for Apple iOS devices) that can be used to generate claims, register claims and validate claims. The OpenCPEs centsiWallet protects client privacy by default using a 1024-bit random secret combined with hashing of the data being submitted.

**Registered Claim (certification or CPE)** – A registered claim is any certification or CPE activity that someone claims to have completed and has registered with OpenCPEs OCL blockchain. Registered claims entries may be unconfirmed (e.g. no direct supporting evidence verified when the claim is made) or confirmed (supporting evidence provided at claim registration time and confirmed). Claims can result in both unaccredited and accredited centsi.

**Registered Claim Update Token** – A registered claim update token is an electronic record associated with a registered claim that can be used by any party involved in the original continuing professional education (CPE) claim to update it, such as revoking it, bundling it with additional claims or simply updating the information within it (such as a change of name or email address). Please note that this feature is not yet available.

**Validating a Registered Claim** (certification or CPE) - Validating a registered claim (certification or CPE) consists of being given the registered claim data and the validation code for it and then checking if it exists in the OpenCPEs OCL blockchain.
