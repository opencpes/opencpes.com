# How we protect our BlockChain

So in theory all client data sent to OpenCPEs is hashed with a large secret nonce and is effectively random data, random data is safe to write to a blockchain and make public, right? But what if the client submitted data isn’t randomi? What if a client manually submits a hash value that is actually their name or other Personally Identifiable Information (PII)? Or what if a client submits illegal data into the OpenCPEs blockchain? By definition blockchains are immutable and we can’t easily remove data. Even if you do remove older entries by rolling back, removing a transaction and then replaying the rest of the transactions that follow the data was still made public and distributed.

The solution is simple: OpenCPEs creates a large random value (a “nonce”) periodically, this nonce is NOT secret, it is made public, and it is added to all client submitted data and then a hash of this is created and entered into the blockchain. This means that no client submitted data is directly entered into the OpenCPEs blockchain. As the OpenCPE’s creates a new nonce periodically and only uses it for a short period of time the chances of a client being able to create an arbitrary input that combined. Its the public OpenCPEs nonce results in data that is PII or illegal is effectively zero. Because OpenCPE can prevent PII, illegal data and other forms of problematic data from getting into the blockchain we can make the data public, safely.

Additionally OpenCPE blockchain records do not contain any identifying data, clients simply submit data, they are turned into validation records and written to the blockchain. This is to help prevent traffic analysis and other forms of meta data leaks.

OpenSource, Open Data, no need to worry about disappearing API’s/Data, we can do this because we protect client privacy and our data
OpenCPEs is not only OpenSource, it is OpenData. Because clients can protect themselves, and we protect the blockchain from the data entered we can make it fully public. This allows us to accept data blindly and write it to our blockchain, this simple strategy ensures that we do not discriminate against data. We also provide a number of APIs such as entry and search, longer term clients can easily provide their own search for example by simply downloading all the data and searching it locally. This also allows everyone to participate fully and equally in OpenCPEs, using it, creating new services and creating new services without any need to ask for permission.
