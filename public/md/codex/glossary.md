# Glossary:

**¢entsi** – ¢entsi (pronounced “centsi”) is a pseudo crypto-currency that can be used to measure the value of Continuing Professional Education (CPE) claims and generally maps at 1 ¢entsi per hour of CPE.

**Certification** - A certification (e.g. technical such as a CSA CCSK) attached to a person that is provided by a third party. Although OpenCPEs supports self-certification claims (e.g. “I claim I can do X”) it is generally accepted that certifications are defined by third parties (e.g. a certification body).

**Certification Claim** - A certification claim is any certification that a person claims to have, but is not yet registered in the OpenCPEs system. The next step would be to use the OpenCPE Wallet to register it resulting in a “Registered Claim”.

**Confirmed Certification Claim or CPE Claim** – A claim can be combined with a piece of digital evidence (such as an image or a PDF) which is confirmed with a trusted third party, if confirmed it is then processed, and an OpenCPE record is created and written to the OCL blockchain. Please note that this feature is not yet available.

**Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Credit** – A Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credit is defined as ANY activity related to common Information Security practitioner activities such as attending or giving conference talks, creating or consuming new information security content (such as blog postings, podcasts, videos, etc.), finding, fixing, and other helping deal with security vulnerabilities and incidents to name a few activities.

**Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Claim** – A CPE Claim is any CPE activity that someone claims to have done, but is not yet registered in the OpenCPEs system. The next step would be to use the OpenCPE Wallet to register it resulting in a “Registered Claim”.

**Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Provider** – A CPE Provider can be a traditional CPE Provider such as an online training session designed to provide CPE’s for the Information Security industry, or a less traditional CPE provider such as an information security related podcast. Please note that a third party CPE provider is not even required for a CPE claim as self claims can be made (e.g. “I wrote this blog posting about information security topic X”).

**Open Cybersecurity Ledger (OCL) Blockchain** – The Open Cybersecurity Ledger (OCL) is a customized blockchain technology developed by CloudSecurityAlliance Labs that ensures the privacy of client data and the security of data entered into the OCL blockchain. Currently it a permissioned, public Blockchain (the data is available publicly in real time).

**Registered Claim (certification or CPE) Token** – A registered claim token is any certification or CPE activity that someone claims to have completed and has registered with OpenCPEs OCL blockchain. Registered claims tokens may be unconfirmed (e.g. no direct supporting evidence verified when the claim is made) or confirmed (supporting evidence provided at claim registration time and confirmed). Claims can result in both unaccredited and accredited ¢entsi.

**Registered Claim Update Token** – A registered claim update token is an electronic record associated with a Registered Claim Token that can be used by any party involved in the original Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Claim to update it, such as revoking it, bundling it with additional claims or simply updating the information within it (such as a change of name or email address). Please note that this feature is not yet available.

**Validating a Registered Claim (certification or CPE) Token** - Validating a Registered Claim (certification or CPE) Token consists of being given a validation code for a Registered Claim (certification or CPE) Token and checking if it exists in the OpenCPEs OCL blockchain.
