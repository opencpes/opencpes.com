# Getting Started With OpenCPEs

There are two ways to get involved with OpenCPEs as a user:

1. Use the OpenCPEs Wallet to submit the QR code claim and activate your ¢entsay immediately

2. Use the email gateway ([centsay@opencpes.com](mailto:centsay@opencpes.com)) to register your QR code claim, you will be able to later activate your ¢entsay using the OpenCPEs Wallet

The OpenCPEs Wallet (a mobile client for Apple iOS and Google Android) is currently under development, if you want to be informed of if when it is available please signup to our [CyberCV Wallet Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/announcements.opencpes.com/d/forum/cybercv-wallet) (a low volume announcement list for OpenCPEs Wallet announcements).

To register your QR code claim via email simply email the picture to [centsay@opencpes.com](mailto:centsay@opencpes.com) and it will added to the Blockchain, allowing you to later prove that you had the QR code on the date of the event and didn't copy and register it at some later date.
