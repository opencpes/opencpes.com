# OpenCPEs Wallet Details

The OpenCPEs Wallet is a mobile client, currently available for Apple iOS in beta and in development for Google Android. If you want to be informed when it becomes available please signup to our [Â¢entsi announcement list](https://groups.google.com/a/announcements.opencpes.com/d/forum/cybercv-wallet).

We designed the OpenCPEs wallet from the ground up to be secure and private. The OpenCPEs wallet does not make direct use of your camera, microphone, location or any other data on your phone. For each transaction with the OpenCPEs OCL blockchain a new transaction key is created. We give the client control of all data sent to the OpenCPEs wallet, and send out from the OpenCPEs wallet.

You can manually enter self claims in to the OpenCPEs wallet by typing an entry in. You can also accept self claims and third party claims by passing data to the application using a custom URL scheme, an easy way to do this is via QR codes. We allow clients to choose how and when they enter data, giving you complete control.
