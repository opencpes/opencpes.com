Privacy considerations: The centsi holds and can be used to submit your most valuable and personal data. As such we have two main strategies to protect your data while it is stored and when it is submitted. For storage we have a simple strategy: you store your own data and you control how your data is distributed, and you are responsible for distribution. In line with this the centsi Wallet does not submit your data for processing to create a validation record. Instead the centsi Wallet generates a random string (a "nonce"), and takes a hash of the original data and the nonce, the centsi Wallet then submits this hash to the OpenCPEs system for witnessing and the creation of the validation record. Your personal data never leaves your system unless you explicitly send it to someone else. You remain in control of your data at all times.
